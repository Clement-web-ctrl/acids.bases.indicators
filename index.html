 <h1 > <u>INDICATORS.</u></h1>
<p> An indicator is a substance that gives a definite color in acids and a different definite  color in bases.</p>
<p ><b>There are three types of indicators.</b></p>
<p>1.Simple 
   acid base 
   indicators
   <br />
2.Commercial 
 indicators
 <br />
3.Universal 
 indicators<br /></p>
<p><b>Preparation of  simple acid indicators. </b></p>
<p>Crush coloured leaves,flowers or roots in a motor using a pestel, add propanone,continue crushing and filter to obtain
  a thick color paste.The resulting paste is a simple acid-base indicator which can be confirmed by adding a few drops 
  of it in a basic solution and other drops in an acidic solution, and it will give a distinct color in base and a 
  distinct color in an acid.                                                                                 
</p>
<p><b>.The disadvantage of this indicator is that they give inconsistent results.<br />
.They expire  within a short time.<br /></b></p>
<p><b>Commercial indicators.</b></p>
<p>These are commercially prepared and they are the ones commonly used in school laboratory as they <mark>give
   consistent results and do not expire easily.</mark>The commonly used indicators are shown below;</p>

       <p>The <b>advantage</b> of methyl orange over phenolphthalein indicator is that it gives
         different distinct colours in acid and neutral solution while phenolphthalein does not. </p>
          <p><u><b>pH Scale and universal indicator</b></u></p>
           <p>pH scale is a numerical scale ranging from 0-14 used to specify the acidity or basicity of an
             aqueous solution.</p>
             <p>Universal indicator is a mixture of indicators.It exhibits a range of colours in acids and in bases
              depending on the strength of the acid or base.When drops of universal indicator are added to a solution 
              ,the colour obtained is compared with that of pH chart to determine the pH of the solution.

<p><b><u>Advantage of universal indicator over other indicators.</u></b>
  <p>It gives information of whether a substance is a strong or a weak base/acid.</p>
  <p><u>How to determine pH of substances using universal indicator.</u></p>
  <p>You can also be told to describe how to test the pH of a solid or a liquid.The procedure below is used
     to determine the pH of a substance.
  </p>
  <p><b>If it is a solid:</b>Add distilled water and stir to dissolve the solid.Dip the universal indicator paper
   or add 2 drops of universal indicator solution to a sample of the resulting solution then match the colour with the 
   pH chart. </p>
   <p><b>If it is a liquid:</b>Dip the universal indicator paper or add 2 drops of universal indicator solution to the 
  liquid then match the colour with the pH chart.</p>

<p>The pH values for acids range from 0 to just less than 7. Lemon juice,orange juice and ethanoic acids are<b>weak acids</b>and have 
pH range between 4-6.</p>
<p><strong>Weak acids</strong> are acids that does not dissociate completely in aqueous solution.</p>
<p>Solutions of Sulphuric (VI) acid,hydrochloric acid and nitric(V)acid have pH which ranges between<b>0-3.</b>They are referred to as 
<b>strong acids.</b></p>
  <p><strong>Strong acids,</strong> this is an acid that dissociates completely to give out many hydrogen ions in aqueous solution.</p>
    <p>The pH values of bases range between 8-14.Soap solution ,calcium hydroxide and toothpaste are <b>weak bases</b>and their pH ranges
     between <b>8-10</b></p>

<p><b>N.B</b></p>
<P>Very reactive metals like <strong>sodium</strong> and <strong>potassium</strong> react violently with acids 
  and should never be tried in a school experiment.</P>
<p>  The reaction between <b>calcium</b> and <b>lead</b> metals with <b>dilute sulphuric (VI) acid</b> slows down
and eventually stops due to the formation of <b>insoluble calcium sulphate</b> and <b>lead(II) sulphate</b> 
respectively which coats the surface of the metal preventing reaction between the acid and the metal.</p>
<p>The reaction between <b>lead metal</b> and <b>hydrochloric acid</b> also slows down and eventually stops due to
 formation of insoluble <b>lead(II)chloride</b> which coats the surface of the metal preventing further reaction
between the acid and the metal.</p>
<p><strong>Copper</strong> metal does not react with dilute acids because copper is below hydrogen in the reactivity
series hence cannot displace hydrogen in acid.</p>
<p><b>a)Reaction with bases</b></p>
<p>Dilute acids react with bases to form salt and water and the reaction is known as <b>neutralization</b></p>
<p>Sodium hydroxide + hydrochloric acid - <b>sodium chloride + water</b></p>
<p>Sodium oxide + nitric(V)acid - <b>sodium nitrate + water</b></p>
<p><b>c)Reaction with carbonates and hydrogen carbonates</b></p>
<p>Acids react with carbonates/hydrogen carbonates to form <em>salt, carbon(IV)oxide</em> and <em>water.</em> This
   reaction is accompanied by effervescence and evolution of an odourless gas that forms a white precipitate with
  calcium hydroxide solution.</p>
  <p><b>Note:</b></p>
  <p><b>Strong acids</b> completely ionize in solution.</p>
  <p><b>Weak acids</b> partially ionize in solution.</p>
    <p><b><u>Uses of acids</u></b></p>
      <p>Sulphuric (VI) acid is used as an electrolyte in car batteries/lead accumulators.</p>
        <p>Dilute sulphuric (VI) acid and dilute hydrochloric acid are used to clean metal surfaces.</p>
         <p>Weak acids are used to treat insect stings e.g wasp bites.</p>
          <p>Nitric (V) acid is used in making fertilizers and explosives.</p>
           <p>Concentrated sulphuric (VI) acid is used as a drying agent for gases that do not react with it .</p>

            <h3 ><u>BASES</u></h3>
            <P><b>Definition:</b> A base is a substance that dissolves in water to form hydroxide ions as the only 
             negative ions. It is defined as a proton acceptor.</P>
             <p>An <b>alkali</b> is soluble base.</p>
               <p ><b><u>Properties of bases</u></b></p>
                <p><b>Physical properties of bases</b></p>
                 <p>1.They have a slippery/soapy feel.</p>
                  <p>2.They have a bitter taste.</p>
                   <p>3.Solutions of bases are good conductors of electricity.</p>
                    <p><b>Chemical properties of bases</b></p>
                     <p>1.They turn red litmus paper blue.</p>
                      <p><b>Reaction with dilute acids</b></p>
                       <p>They react with acids to form salt and water as the only products.</p>
                        <p><b>Thermal decomposition</b></p>
                         <p>Most metals are decomposed by heat to form oxides and water.</p>
                         <p><b><u>Uses of bases</u></b></p>
                        <p>1.To manufacture toothpaste.</p>
                       <p>2.Used to manufacture anti-acid and ingestion tablets e.g magnesium hydroxide.</p>
                      <p>3.Sodium hydroxide is used to manufacture soap, paper and cement.</p>
                     <p>4.Calcium oxide and hydroxide is used to reduce soil acidity and manufacture of cement.</p>
                    <p>5.Bases are used to  treat insect bites like ant and bee stings.</p>
                  <p><b><u>Nature of oxides</u></b></p>
                <p>This refers to whether the oxide is acidic,neutral,basic or amphoteric.</p>
              <p><b>1.Acidic oxides-</b> these are usually non-metal oxides that dissolve in water to form acidic 
               solutions e.g <em>sulphuric (IV) oxide, caron (IV) oxide, sulphur (VI) oxide,nitrogen (IV) oxide e.
                t.c </em></p>
            <p><b>2.Basic oxides-</b> these are usually metal oxides that react with dilute acids to form salt and water
             only. E.g <em>Sodium oxide, Magnesium oxide, Potassium oxide, Calcium oxide e.t.c</em> </p>
          <p><b>3.Neutral oxide:-</b> these are oxides that have no effect on red and blue litmus paper, and they 
            do not react with acids or bases. E.g <em>Carbon(II)oxide, Nitrogen(I)oxide, Nitrogen(II)oxide, water(oxide
              of hydrogen) </em></p>
        <p><b>4.Amphoteric oxides:-</b> these are oxides that have the characteristics of both acids and bases.E.g 
         <em>Aluminium oxide, zinc oxide and lead(II)oxide.</em> They react with both acids and bases.</p>
